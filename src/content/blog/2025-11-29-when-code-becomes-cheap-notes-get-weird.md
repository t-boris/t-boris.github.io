Recently I realized I have stopped "taking notes" in the usual sense.
Instead of opening a doc and typing bullet points, I open a code editor and build a tiny website.

Thanks to AI, writing basic web apps has quietly become as cheap as writing a long email. You throw a prompt at an AI assistant, mumble something about Flask or Next.js, and suddenly you have a running page with structure, navigation, and space for your ideas. The hard part is no longer *how* to code it, but *what exactly* you want to say and how you want people to experience it.

## From Notebooks to Web Apps

That's what happened with my notes for **Machine Learning for Business Analytics**. Instead of a static summary of concepts, I turned the material into a page where I can lay out intuition, formulas, and examples in a way that feels more like a small product than a notebook. It's still "just notes," but they now look suspiciously like a learning tool.

Same story with **microeconomics** and the rest of my **iMBA** materials. If I'm going to agonize over demand curves, cost structures, and all those lovely efficiency losses, I might as well package them in a format where I can add visuals, highlight key ideas, and, if I feel like it, bolt on more functionality later. It's like my course notes have quietly hired a front-end developer.

I posted one of these pages in our internal university network to show what I was doing. I expected a couple of polite likes and maybe one "cool" reaction. Instead, I got a surprising number of positive responses and real interest. Apparently, "turn your notes into a web app" resonates with more people than I thought.

## Structure Becomes the Main Design Variable

What fascinates me here is not "look, I made a page," but how our relationship with information is shifting.
When code becomes cheap, *structure* becomes the main design variable. Notes are no longer just text you stash away; they're interfaces you design for your future self and for other people who might stumble across them.

We're used to thinking of knowledge as paragraphs and pages. Now it's turning into layouts, flows, and interactions. You don't just read; you navigate. You don't just highlight; you click, filter, and reframe. The line between "my personal notes" and "a tiny learning platform" starts to blur, and honestly, it's kind of fun.

## AI's Strange Role

AI plays a strange role in this. It doesn't just help us write more text; it helps us *wrap* that text in structure: sections, routes, tooltips, components, micro-copy, even little diagrams. The work shifts from "can I build this?" to "what's the most meaningful way to present this idea so future-me (and my classmates) can actually use it?"

There's also a philosophical side effect: when it's this easy to turn ideas into working software, the distance between thinking and building shrinks. My notes stop being a private, linear record of what I heard in class and start becoming artifacts I can share, reuse, and grow. They're less like a diary and more like an evolving knowledge garden with a URL.

## The Distance Between Thinking and Building Shrinks

And hilariously, all of this grew out of something very mundane: I just needed a place to store course notes. Yet here we are, with a world where "I'm studying for my ML exam" can include spinning up a cloud app that hosts your study materials for anyone curious enough to click.

So if you see a link like [this ML for Business Analytics study app](https://ml-for-business-analytics-module-1-540582499585.us-west1.run.app/) in a course forum and think, "Wait, is this still just someone's notes?"—the answer is yes. It's notes. They just happen to compile and deploy now.

## What This Means

We're entering a phase where the tools to create are becoming as cheap as the tools to consume. The friction between "I want to share this thought" and "here's a working interface for it" is disappearing.

That changes how we think about:
- **Learning**: Notes become interactive learning environments
- **Sharing**: Knowledge becomes navigable, not just readable
- **Creating**: The barrier between idea and implementation dissolves

The hard part is no longer the code. The hard part is knowing what you want to say and designing the experience around it. And that's a much more interesting problem to solve.
