Lately I have been doing something I did not expect to enjoy this much:
recording Russian poetry and turning it into small video clips.

The poems are in Russian, but I want to share the story here in English to
document the process and remind myself that a simple microphone experiment can
grow into a creative project.

## It All Started With a Microphone

The whole thing began very simply: I bought an Audio-Technica **AT2035**.

It is a condenser mic, not some crazy high-end studio monster, but a solid,
reliable piece of gear. I plugged it in, set it up, and started reading Russian
poems out loud. No big production plan, no long-term strategy. Just me, my
voice, and the text.

To my surprise, I liked how it sounded. The AT2035 gave the voice enough warmth
and clarity that I actually wanted to keep listening to my own recordings.
Usually you hear yourself on tape and think, "Do I really sound like that?" This
time I thought, "Okay... this I can work with."

## Recording Russian Poems

Most of what I recorded were Russian poems that mean something to me, including
several by **Joseph Brodsky**.

There is a particular feeling in reading Brodsky out loud. His rhythm is sharp,
almost architectural. When you speak it, you do not just say the poem; you walk
through it, like a space built out of words. The microphone just captures that
walk.

A typical recording session looked like this:

- Choose a poem (often Brodsky).
- Read it silently a few times to catch the rhythm and intonation.
- Hit record and read it out loud.
- Stop, listen, hate something, re-record.
- Repeat until the voice feels honest and not theatrical.

No studio, no special room treatment. Just a basic home setup, a condenser mic,
and a bit of stubbornness.

## From Audio to Video: Turning Poems Into Clips

Pretty quickly, just having audio was not enough. I wanted to **see** the poem.

So I started building **video clips** around my voice recordings. Instead of
heavy manual editing for every single frame, I leaned on modern tools that can
generate or enhance visuals from text and ideas. The goal was not to make
perfect cinema, but to create visual atmospheres that match the emotional tone
of each poem.

That is how the audio experiment turned into a series of short video clips to
Russian poetry, especially to Brodsky.

## The Tools I Used: GenSpark, Grok, and Veo 3.1

To create the visual part, I played with different systems:

### GenSpark.ai

For a good portion of the work, I used **GenSpark.ai**.

I would describe the mood of the poem, the setting, the feeling, and let the
system propose visuals. Sometimes it nailed it from the first attempt. Sometimes
I had to iterate a bit, refining prompts until the video felt closer to the
poem.

GenSpark was useful for building those poetic scenes: foggy streets, abstract
reflections, lonely rooms, and small visual metaphors that do not scream but
quietly resonate with the voice.

### Grok

From time to time, I also used **Grok**. It did not replace anything; it gave me
a second opinion. Another angle, another interpretation. Sometimes Grok's
output was rougher, sometimes unexpectedly bold, and that helped me escape from
repeating the same visual pattern.

### Veo 3.1 (Google)

And then there is **Veo 3.1** from Google.

This one I used directly, often when I wanted something more cinematic or fluid.
Veo is less about static nice frames and more about motion, transitions, and the
feeling that the image is alive.

For certain poems, that movement mattered a lot, especially when the text deals
with time, memory, or inner change. You read a line, and you want the image not
just to sit there, but to slowly transform with the meaning.

## What Came Out of It

In the end, I ended up with:

- Several voice recordings of Russian poems, including Brodsky.
- A set of video clips where my voice and the generated visuals live together.
- A process that is technically simple but emotionally rich.

The combination that works for me:

- The voice: human, personal, slightly imperfect.
- The text: strong, time-tested poetry in Russian.
- The visuals: built with help from AI tools like GenSpark.ai, Grok, and Veo
  3.1.

It feels like a collaboration between three layers: the poet, the reader, and
the machine.

## Watch the Clips on YouTube

Here are some of the videos that came out of this experiment:

Each combines my reading of Russian poetry with visuals generated using the
tools above. They are different in mood but come from the same simple idea: give
the poem a voice and a moving image.

## Why This Matters to Me

This project reminded me of a few things:

- You do not need a huge plan to start a meaningful creative experiment.
  Sometimes you just buy a microphone and read a poem.
- Modern tools do not kill creativity; they shift it. Less time goes to
  technical grind, more to choosing mood, rhythm, and meaning.
- Working with poetry in your own voice is therapeutic. You hear how you handle
  silence, pauses, tension, and it tells you a lot about yourself.

I am not pretending this is a giant art project. It is a small, honest practice:
taking Russian poems I love, reading them into a good microphone, and letting
modern tools help wrap them in visuals. For now, that is enough. The rest will
grow from there.
